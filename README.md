### Roles

This template creates a [managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for your app inside your Azure Active Directory tenant, and it is used to authenticate your app with Azure and other services that support Azure AD authentication like Key Vault via access policies. You will see principalId referenced in the infrastructure as code files, that refers to the id of the currently logged in Azure Developer CLI user, which will be granted access policies and permissions to run the application locally. To view your managed identity in the Azure Portal, follow these [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-view-managed-identity-service-principal-portal).

### Key Vault

This template uses [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to securely store your Azure SQL connection string for the provisioned Azure SQL Database. Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets (API keys, passwords, certificates, cryptographic keys) and makes it simple to give other Azure services access to them. As you continue developing your solution, you may add as many secrets to your Key Vault as you require.
